## Description

Single page JavaScript application that displays the user a matrix
of colored tiles. where the user has to spot the tile which has a different color. If the user clicks the right
tile the game continues and the user gets the next level of difficulty presented. If the click is wrong
the game ends.

## How to run the Application

install yarn:

`https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install`

clone this repository, then run for installing all necessary packages:

`yarn install`

finally, to run the application in your browser:

`yarn start`

see more details below.

## How to run tests

just run:

`yarn test`

see more details below.

## How to run a script to win the game

in the root of the project has a file called:

`scriptToWinTheGame.js`

copy the content and paste in your browser console and press enter, to automatically spot the right tile every second.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
